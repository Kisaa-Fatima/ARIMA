## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to preprocess time series data, analyze its components, and build a forecasting model using ARIMA. The steps include:
- Loading and preprocessing the data
- Visualizing trends, seasonality, and noise
- Decomposing the time series
- Testing for stationarity
- Determining ARIMA parameters
- Building and evaluating the ARIMA model
- Forecasting future sales

  ## Dataset
  The dataset used is car_data.csv.
